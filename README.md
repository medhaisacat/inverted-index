# inverted-index
Inverted index implementation based on a user interface. Files and sample content are input to the program along with the query term/terms to be searched. The program returns a list of files containing the input query term/ terms. This program is written using node js.

## Installation
Use the below command for installation
```shell
$ npm --silent install
```

## Usage
Run the command and provide the input as follows. The search terms are to be entered later.
``` shell
$ npm --silent start
$ file1 Happy Birthday!
$ file2 oneko returns a cat
$ file3 Jake Peralta is an amazing detective/genius
$ file4 April
```

## Future work
Modify to recursively read files off a directory to populate the inverted index.
